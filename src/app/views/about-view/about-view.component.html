    <p>This project was started because I want to have an easier way to create <a href="https://zmk.dev/" target="_blank">
      ZMK&nbsp;<fa-icon [icon]="faExternalLinkAlt"></fa-icon></a> keymaps for the keyboards that I build. The existing
      process of editing a C source file is quite error prone, especially for someone who is not familiar with that
      language.</p>

    <p>The application lets you graphically order the keys so that the layout on screen resembles the physical layout of
      the keyboard. The main goal however is to assign behaviors to the keys and then to generate the C source file(s)
      that are the basis for the firmware.</p>

    <p>In an ideal situation the editor can commit and push the source files to the github remote which then starts the
      build workflow (to be done). The resulting firmware artefacts are then downloadable to the local system.</p>

    <p>The source code for this application is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tammingaj/keymap-editor">
      hosted on Github&nbsp;<fa-icon [icon]="faExternalLinkAlt"></fa-icon></a></p>

    <p>Load a sample keymap to start playing around:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Corne</li>
      <li>Miniki v2</li>
      <li>SoftRubbing</li>
      <li>Fumble board</li>
    </ul>
